# RTLFix-Client

# Repository is now archived because the mod isn't supported anymore, because it isn't needed in 1.16.2

RTLFix Client is a Minecraft [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net/use) mod to fix RTL text writing. It does this with any Text field widget (Chat, Create World Screen, creative inventory), and it also does it with Signs and Books.

RTLFix-Client has a Serverside counterpart, called RTLFix-Fabric. ~~When the 2 mods are used together, they cancel out each other. I'm working on a way to send packets to tell the server that the client is using the mod, so the server ignores that player.~~ Finished the packets, mod fully working.
