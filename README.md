# RTLFix-Client
RTLFix Client is a Minecraft [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net/use) mod to fix RTL text writing. It does this with any Text field widget (Chat, Create World Screen, creative inventory), and it also does it with Signs and Books.

RTLFix-Client has a Serverside counterpart, called RTLFix-Fabric. When the 2 mods are used together, they cancel out each other. I'm working on a way to send packets to tell the server that the client is using the mod, so the server ignores that player.
